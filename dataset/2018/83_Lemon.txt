The truth will set you free
But first, it'll piss you off (hey)
Bad bitches wanna be my bae
(Hey) hunt me down like the C.I.A.
(Hey) side of my car, tryna see my face
(Hey) want me to beat it like the T.I. case
Oh (hey) and if it's heated I'ma feed my face
(Hey) and best believe, it's gon' be outrageous
(Hey) hatin' niggas can't believe my race
(Hey) niggas hit you with the Eli face, oh
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'
Scrunchin' their eyes with your name in their mouth and
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'
you keep askin' me where I'm from
(Hey) about the borders and, "Did I run?"
(Hey) keep askin' how I feel 'bout guns
There's a light (hey) and dark army, which side you choose?
Oh (hey), if not now, then when?
(Hey) and if not me, then who?
(Hey) don't drink the Kool-Aid, my friends
(Hey) I tried to tell y'all about this dude
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'
Hate supplements are found right in their couches
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'

It's just your eyes get acidic (wait a minute)
And this here ain't a scrimmage
Motherfucker, we ain't finished (wait, wait a minute)

Got the hazards on, only doin' five (wait, wait a minute)
You can catch me, Rih', in the new La Ferrar' (wait, wait a minute)
And the truck behind me got arms
Yeah, longer than LeBron
Just waitin' for my thumb like The Fonz
Woo! This beat tastes like lunch (wait, wait a minute)
But it's runnin' from veneers, and it's runnin' from the fronts
But every day, hey, wasn't lemonade (wait, wait a minute)
I was afraid, once a nigga graduate (wait, wait a minute)
Would I be okay? (Wait, wait a minute)
So I prayed and I prayed
It's Rihanna, nigga, my constellation in space (wait, wait a minute)
Warp speed, Doctor Spock couldn't chase (wait, wait a minute)

Bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
