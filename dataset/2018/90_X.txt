vThat day I saw you and I felt your energy
 Since then I don't want you away from me
 I know you don't know about me and I can't lie to you
 What they say on the street about me
 and I will not deny you
 We are clear and already
 I'm not going to deny it (I can't deny it)
 We are clear and now (we are clear, we are clear)
 Just let me grab you, baby
 Kisses on the neck to quench the thirst
 My hands on your hips to start as it is
 We are not going to go down anymore mom (no)
 Ba-ba-ba-ba-baila, plate, plate
 How she moves it, non-stop, non-stop
 The desire to eat you is now stronger
 Want you
 and I will not deny you
 We are clear and already
 I will not deny you
 We are clear and already
 What I've seen of you mommy, it's not normal
 But don't worry I'm abnormal
 I know your friends must not like me, huh
 But go and tell him part by part
 How we have sex and I take away your stress
 give it again
 and I will not deny you
 We are clear and already
 I will not deny you
 We are clear and already (no)
 Ba-ba-ba-ba-baila, plate, plate
 As she moves it, non-stop, non-stop
 The desire to eat you is now stronger
 Want you
 And I'm not going to deny you (ah, ah) (ba-ba-ba-ba-baila, plata, plata)
 N.I.C.K (as she moves it, non-stop, non-stop)
 J Balvin man
 Nicky, Nicky, Nicky Jam (the desire to eat you is stronger now, I want to have you)

 I'm not going to talk much
 Let the beat keep on breaking
