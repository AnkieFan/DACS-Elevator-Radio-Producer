If the rhythm leads you to shake your head, we already started how it is
My music doesn't discriminate against anyone so let's break
With mine everyone moves
The party is in my genes
I am the queen of children
My people do not stop, here nobody wants to leave
If the rhythm is in your head
Now let go and move your feet
I love when the bass plays
We start to level up
All my people move
The party is in my genes
I am the queen of children
My music has them dancing hard and they dance like that

Tamo' breaking the disco
The party doesn't stop, it's just beginning
C'est comme-ci, c'est comme-ça
Ma chérie, la la la la la
France, Columbia, Houston (Freeze)

DJs don't lie, my people like it and that went worldwide (Freeze)
We do not lower it, but we never stop it is another stick and Blam!
