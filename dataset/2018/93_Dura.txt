when i saw her
I said, "If that woman was for me"
Forgive me, I had to tell you

'You are hard, hard
hard, hard, hard
That you are hard, hand up because you look good
'You're tough, mamacita, you've gone from level
Last, look how your skin shines
'You're hard, tell me, tell me, how is that?
'You are hard, I give you a twenty out of ten
'You are hard, hard, hard

You are the machine, the dance machine
If you don't have anyone, come to my arms, fall
That perfume is in the air
Something like Argentina, you bring me Buenos Aires
'Tá powerful, half scandalous
There will be many women but you are something else
If it was a crime that you're beautiful
I arrest you in my bed and put the handcuffs on you
You got the touch, touch, touch
Look at the material, special edition
You got the touch, touch, touch
Forgive me, I had to tell you
You might also like
'You are hard, hard
hard, hard, hard
That you are hard, hand up because you look good
'You're tough, mamacita, you've gone from level
Last, look how your skin shines
'You're hard, tell me, tell me, how is that?
'You are hard, I give you a twenty out of ten
'You are hard, hard, hard

I like how that ram-pam-pam moves
My mind machining in a plan-plan-plan
If he leaves me, in that curve I give him pam-pam
I don't know what your recipe is, you're here to eat well
I like how that ram-pam-pam moves
My mind machining in a plan-plan-plan
If he leaves me, in that curve I give him pam-pam
Your beauty rumbles, the others pa' the grave

One, two and three, let's give it, envy to shut up
Greetings to all the girls who paralyze the street
What is your name? where are you from?
Give me the number to go into details with you
And you got the touch, touch, touch
You look like a star making a ruckus
You got the touch, touch, touch
The internet goes down when you upload a photo
When I saw her (Tell me, baby girl)
I said: "If that woman was for me" (Pa' mí ese baby)
Forgive me, I had to tell you

'You are hard, hard
hard, hard, hard
That you are hard, hand up because you look good
'You're tough, mamacita, you've gone from level
Last, look how your skin shines
'You're hard, tell me, tell me, how is that?
'You are hard, I give you a twenty out of ten
'You are hard, hard, hard

You have the size, there is no other like you mommy
Hit it up, boom bye bye
That you have the size, there is no other like you mommy
Hit it up, boom bye bye
That you have the size, there is no other like you mommy
Hit it up, boom bye bye
That you have the size, there is no other like you mommy
Hit it up, boom bye bye, yep, yeah
