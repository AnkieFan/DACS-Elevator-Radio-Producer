In a Hellcat because I was raised in hell
Made man, I don't owe no favors to no nigga
When you get that money nigga keep your heart
I'm sliding in the car, don't need a key to start
I take the gun with me to the BET Awards
When your well runs dry, you know you need me for that
When I pull up in the Buick, you know what I'm doing
If the police get behind me, I'll run and run
Sleeping on the palette turned me wild
I'm a project baby, now I live in Calabasas
As if I still serve the demons, as if I'm still claiming
I'm drinking lean, I try to keep my balance
Riding that Z-Walk, Dickie's with my Reeboks
I don't say much, I just let the gun do the talking
Your jewels move in water, diamonds like re-rock
My girl rides the dick like she's on a seesaw
When I entered the scene, I had a crosshair
When I joined Beam', I was in Celine
Little girl, you're just a fling, that's not what I mean
Money popping out of my jeans like I do the scheme
Entering a Demon, by God (By God)
Looks like I still do fraud (Fraud)
Flying in the private jet with a gun (Gun)
That Z shit, that Z shit (That Z shit)
Entering a Demon, by God (By God)
Looks like I still do fraud (Fraud)
Flying in the private jet with a gun (Gun)
That Z shit, that Z shit (That Z shit)
