I gotta feed the streets, my pistol will bleed the streets
Balaclava in my face, sometimes you gotta cheat
To stay ahead of this motherfucker (Gang), I drank lean like it was liquor
Street life will make you reach God faster (Yeah, gang)
Adhesive, AK-40 straight to your liver
Let the rifle hit you like a Blood or a Cripper (Gang)
Flipper, so many shots, I'm a gymnast
I made so much money off these suckers, off these suckers (Yeah, gang)

I am the body-slayer lord, the Slaughter Gang is the soul-taker
It's not a regular F-150, that's a fucking Raptor
No lie, I'm a street nigga, not a rapper
The rifle hit him and he turned into a little bitch
Smith & Wesson, I'm representing the 4L Gang
We baptized more niggas than the reverend (Yeah)
Kappa Alpha, me and my gang, we do all the steps
Who are you checking? The shot of this FN goes from the East to the West End (Gang)

yeah
I heard that Papi is out there
And he's got the double-R convertible outside
Checked the weather and it's getting really weird out there
I'ma release this shit and make these assholes go down like a goddamnâ€”
Type of guy who can't look me in the eye
I despise
When I see you, better put that damn pride aside
Many times, many times, I survived
The bullshit is happening, spoiler alert, this guy dies
You might also like
I'm armed and you know weed is sticky
My finger itches, the Glock likes to leave holes
Your shooters are iffy, a street punk could never disrespect me
I come straight from 6 and we don't spare the sixty

I had sex with her, with her too and her
I wanted to make a mistake and I tell her to make a mistake, for sure
Damn voodoo, got him while I flew with the Turks
I know niggas had to hit 'em where we know it hurts

Gang thing, that's what I'm into (Yeah)
Gang thing, that's what I'm into
Man, gang stuff, that's what I'm into
Gang thing, that's what I'm into
Man, gang stuff, that's what I'm into
Gang thing, that's what I'm into
Man, gang stuff, that's what I'm into
Gang thing, that's what I'm into

Let it fire, fire, let it fire, fire
Till his brain locked up and his mother sang
And the shepherd sang and the bullets sang
And the shooters arrived and the choir sang
I'm everywhere
Jacob charged me 450K for a small chain
US Open, with our presence in the tennis game
Tell the coach not to take me away, I like to watch the games until the end
And my lyric is insane and my partners are insane
There are about 80 of us now, that's the scariest thing
What they're doing on that other side is embarrassing
We in Paris with it, a hundred carats with it
All this shit is for my son, because he will inherit

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'll shoot you
Gang
Subway

Gang thing, that's what I'm into
Gang thing, that's what I'm into
Man, gang stuff, that's what I'm into
Gang thing, that's what I'm into
Man, gang stuff, that's what I'm into
Gang thing, that's what I'm into
Man, gang stuff, that's what I'm into
Gang thing, that's what I'm into, yeahEmbed
