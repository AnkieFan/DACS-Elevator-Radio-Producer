Who would have thought that it could be
make love by telepathy
The moon is full, my bed is empty
what i would do to you
If I were in front of you, your mind would be blown away
Night and day, night and day

You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private plane
kilometers away we are connecting
And you turn me on even though you're not touching me
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
And tell me everything you're thinking
I can imagine what you are already plotting

Who would have thought that it could be
make love by telepathy
The moon is full, my bed is empty
what i would do to you
If I were in front of you, your mind would be blown away
Night and day, night and day
You might also like
You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind, I can read your mind
What do you want to do?
It's written all over your face, times two
'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind
I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe
(On repeat)

Who would have thought that it could be
make love by telepathy
The moon is full, my bed is empty
what i would do to you
If I were in front of you, your mind would be blown away
Night and day, night and day

(You know I got a lot to say)
(All these voices in the background of my brain)93Embed
