One, two
One, two, three, four

The wind blows your hair
uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
those beautiful eyes kill me
uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
I like your smell, the color of your skin
and how you make me feel
I like your little mouth, that pink lipstick
And how do you kiss me (Yeh)

I want to wake up with you
Do it after smoking (Hey)
I no longer have anything to look for
something out of here
You combine with the sea
That bikini looks great
There is no gravity that can lift me
You make me sick (Yah!)
You might also like
You accelerate all my heartbeats
And e' that I like everything about you
From all your part, which one do I decide?
And e' that I like everything about you

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
And e' that I like everything about you
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
And e' that I like everything about you

Fifth Avenue, does not go to the mall
She knows that only one call came to her
In the Raptor I like to put it in four
The large jogger, the small shirt
like the keto diet
For you, I control myself and stay still
Although I want to eat you completely
From that ass I became a teco, eh
Mi-Mi-Micro dosi', rola, oxi
Kissing that' lipâ€™ glossy
I already gave it in all the 'posi
Coconut shampoo, Chanel her wallet
It drives me crazy from the helmet to the 'pedal'
I want to wake up with you (Oh-oh)
do it after smoking
I no longer have anything to look for
something out of here
You combine with the sea (Eh)
That bikini looks phenomenal (Eh-eh)
There is no gravity that can lift me
You make me sick (Yah!)

You accelerate all my heartbeats
And e' that I like everything about you
Of all your parts, which one do I decide?
And e' that I like everything about you

Ah, ah-ah (All of you), ah-ah (All of you), ah-ah
And e' that I like everything about you
Ah, ah-ah (All of you), ah-ah (All of you), ah-ah
And e' that I like everything about you
