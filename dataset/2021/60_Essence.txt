Only you
Only you
Yeah-yeah

What is the use of listening to people?
If our connection is not understood
Why deny the pleasures?
I can't although sometimes I try
It is always 'put on for' me
no one compares to you
You are a work of art
I swear that

You don't need no other body
You don't need no other body
Give it to me daddy
Only if you hold my body (You and I, you and I)
Only if you hold my body (My body)
You don't need no other body

Just call me
Send me the ubi' and I'll get to where you are
she came to you
I lose myself in your skin
How it fascinates me touring myself
you raise my feeling
Cuz you don't wanna waste so please me
put ya lips on mine
Light, set fire all night
You might also like
When you kiss me, you make me delirious
When you're on my body, baby, don't want you to stop
An intensity, out of the ordinary
I need all of your love, I could never enough
When you kiss me, you make me delirious
When you're on my body, baby, don't want you to stop
An intensity, out of the ordinary (Only you)

You don't need no other body
You don't need no other body
Give it to me daddy
Only if you hold my body (You and I, you and I)
Only if you hold my body (My body)
You don't need no other body

Baby
For you I will fight, our love anything goes
(It tastes so good)
That it slips for me to let them talk
This is priceless
A love you can't buy with money
Ain't nobody that come closer
You know, they are far from your league
Give you what you need
Give you what you need
Give you what you
Give me all you need
Give you what you need
Give you what
Yes, I give you everything
I give you everything
you give me everything
I give you everything, baby
You don't need no other body
You don't need no other body
Give it to me daddy
Only if you hold my body (You and I, you and I)
Only if you hold my body (My body)
Only you
Only you
Yeah-yeah

When you kiss me, you make me delirious
When you're on my body, baby, don't want you to stop
An intensity, out of the ordinary
I need all of your love, I could never enough
When you kiss me, you make me delirious
When you're on my body, baby, don't want you to stop
An intensity, out of the ordinary
Only you
Only you
Yeah-yeahEmbed
