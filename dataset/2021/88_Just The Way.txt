I love you just the way God made you
Girl, he don't make mistakes
What you call your imperfections
I call beautiful, babe
(Tell 'em, Blanc)
The way your hair's in a mess in the morning
When you open your eyes
The way an hour goes by
When you say that you'll be ready in five, yeah, uh
The little dimple on the side of your smile
When you're laughing
At a movie that you've seen about a thousand times
You know, girl, that I can't lie
I love you just the way God made you
Girl, he don't make mistakes
What you call your imperfections
I call beautiful, babe
So let my eyes be your mirror
And you're bound to see it too
'Cause I was made for loving
Just the way God made you
Just the way, just the way
Just the way, just the way
God made you
(God made you)
Just the way, just the way
Just the way, just the way
God made you, yeah
The flush in your cheeks when you're mad
But you say that you're not (yeah)
And the shape of the face
That you make when you're taking a shot (taking a shot)
The little white lie that you told the security guard
At the hotel pool when we got caught
Yeah, I was thinking, girl
You never looked so hot (you never looked so hot)
And that I love you just the way God made you
Girl, he don't make mistakes
What you call your imperfections
I call beautiful, babe
So let my eyes be your mirror
And you're bound to see it too
'Cause I was made for loving
Just the way God made you
Just the way, just the way
Just the way, just the way
God made you
(God made you)
Just the way, just the way
Just the way, just the way
God made you, uh
Girl, I ain't ever gon' try to change ya (come on)
My masterpiece, my Mona Lisa, and I need ya
To stay just the way God made ya (just the way, just the way
Just the way, just the way God made you)
Just the way God made you (just the way, just the way
Just the way, just the way God made you)
I love you just the way God made you
Girl, he don't make mistakes
What you call your imperfections
I call beautiful, babe
So let my eyes be your mirror
And you're bound to see it too
'Cause I was made for loving
Just the way God made you
Just the way, just the way
Just the way, just the way
God made you
(God made you)
Just the way, just the way
Just the way, just the way
God made you
(God made you)
Just the way, just the way
Just the way, just the way
