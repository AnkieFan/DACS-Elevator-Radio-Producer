Baby, I already found out, it shows when you see me'
There where you have not arrived'or knows' that I will take you
And tell me what you want to drink, is that you are my baby
And who is going to talk about us? If we don't let ourselves be seen

And sometimes' e' Dolce, sometimes' Bulgari
When I take it from you after I left it
The glass' of wine, the pound' of mari
You are very loose, I am on safari
You move your phenomenal ass
For me to devour you like an animal
If he hasn't come to you, I'm going to wait for you
In my bed and I'm going to celebrate

Baby, I'm not opposed to you
And I always put it on you
And if you pull me, we're going to swim in the depths
If it's for me, I'll put it on you
From September to August
To me without cojone' what your' friend' say

Mommy, she has me 'juquea'o, yes
If it were' the Uru', I would have' parked' or
Turning 'by County, with you always snatched' or
You are not my lady, but
Take five grand, spend it at Sephora
Louis Vuitton no longer buys at Pandora
Like piercing, the man pierces, eh-eh-eh

Some time ago they broke his heart (The heart)
Studious, ready to be a doctor (Doctor)
But (But), he likes the puppets 'wheeling motorboat (Motora)
I am for you twenty-four hours

Baby, I'm not opposed to you
And I always put it on you (-pre put it on you)
And if you pull me, we're going to swim deep (Swim deep)
If it's for me I'll put it to you
