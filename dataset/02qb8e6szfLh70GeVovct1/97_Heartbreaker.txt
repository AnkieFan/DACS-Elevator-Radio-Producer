Once I had to see a man
Sometimes think about him
But you know
I'm barely here

Memories don't call
I just can't live without him
So hard to bear

Heartbreaker
Can't take him
Heartbreaker
Breaking me down
Heartbreaker
Can't take him
Heartbreaker
Breaking me down

I don't cry no more
I live while flying
Passing by
And you can hear me say
You might also like
Heartbreaker
Can't take him
Heartbreaker
Breaking me down
Heartbreaker
Can't take him
Heartbreaker
Breaking me down


Heartbreaker
Can't take him
Heartbreaker
Breaking me down
Heartbreaker
Can't take him
Heartbreaker
Breaking me down

Heartbreaker
Oh, breaking me down, no, no, no
Oh, babe
Heartbreaker, breaker, breaker, breaker
Heartbreaker
Can't take him
Heartbreaker
Breaking me down
Heartbreaker
Can't take him
Heartbreaker
Breaking me down
