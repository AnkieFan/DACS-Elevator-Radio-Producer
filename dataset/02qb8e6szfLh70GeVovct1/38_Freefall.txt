I'm in a freefall like a snowflake falling
Down, down, down, down, down
I close my eyes, inside my head I stumble
Helpless to the ground

Down, down, down, down, down
Oh, yeah

Smoke rings around me and bright sparks of fire
Flash by as I go
I've got the feeling and it takes me higher
Than I'll ever know

Go, go, go, go, go
Oh!
