It's a well known situation
Telling harder to avoid
And it's constantly frustrating
Like a mid paranoid

It's when you think you're a winner
Your head it hits the ground
Stare into the faces
You hear no sound

Oh, oh, oh, falling down
Oh, oh, oh, falling down
Oh, oh, oh, falling down
Oh, oh, oh, falling down
I'm tumbling, tumbling

I wake up into the sunlight
Feels warm upon my face
My head feels like a furnace
I don't recognise this place

Oh but what's this strange sensation
I must be in New York
It builds to anillation
Ooh don't stop, ooh don't stop

Oh, oh, oh, falling down
Oh, oh, oh, falling down
Oh, oh, oh, falling down
Oh, oh, oh, falling down
I'm tumbling, tumbling

Start to think that you're a winner
Your head it hits the ground
Stare out into the faces
You hear no sound

Oh, oh, oh, falling down
Oh, oh, oh, falling down
Oh, oh, oh, falling down
Oh, oh, oh, falling down
I'm tumbling, tumbling
