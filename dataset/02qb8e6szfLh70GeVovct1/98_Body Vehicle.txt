We cherished something but it is gone now
Bitter the taste but sweet as it goes down
We cherished something but it is gone now
She's got a gun in a sock in her drawer
An ugly mistake
I wasn't born with a bug I'm just stuck in a
Place that I want to escape
In my head once again
I feel the hair raise on my skin
Am I living am I dead
If I stop breathing in my bed
Wipe the sweat from my forehead
I feel a paranoia agent
Vivid thoughts I don't intend
Take control until I bend
Tonight I'm caught in my mind I might
Be missing something in my life
I don't want to be alone
But you may not enter my zone
In my body vehicle
I ride till I turn cold
You might also likeIn my head once again
I feel the hair raise on my skin
Am I living am I dead
If I stop breathing in my bed
Wipe the sweat from my forehead
I feel a paranoia agent
Vivid thoughts I don't intend
Take control until I bend
Tonight I'm caught in my mind I might
Be missing something in my life
I don't want to be alone
But you may not enter my zone
In my body vehicle
I ride till I turn cold
I don't want to be alone
But you may not enter my zone
In my body vehicle
I ride till I turn coldEmbed
