Oh!
Fonsi, D.Y.
Oh, oh no, oh no (oh)
hey yeah
Diridiri, dirididi Daddy
Go!
Yes, you know that I've been looking at you for a while
I have to dance with you today (DY)
I saw that your look was already calling me
Show me the way that I'm going
Oh you, you are the magnet and I am the metal
I am getting closer and I am putting together the plan
Just thinking about it makes your pulse race (oh yeah)
Now, I'm already liking you more than usual
All my senses are asking for more
This must be taken without any rush
Slowly
I want to breathe your neck slowly
Let me tell you things in my ear
So that you remember if you are not with me
Slowly
I want to undress you with kisses slowly
Sign the walls of your maze
And make your whole body a manuscript (go up, go up, go up)
(Go up, go up) Oh
I want to see your hair dance
I want to be your rhythm (uh oh, uh oh)
That you teach my mouth (uh oh, uh oh)
Your favorite places (favorite, favorite baby)
Let me bypass your danger zones (uh oh, uh oh)
Until you provoke your screams (uh oh, uh oh)
And that you forget your last name (dirididi Daddy)
I know you're thinking about it (eh)
I've been trying for a while (eh)
Mommy, this is giving and giving it
You know that your heart with me makes you bam bam
You know that this baby is looking for my bam bam
Come taste my mouth to see how she tastes you
I want, I want, I want to see how much love fits you
I'm not in a hurry, I want to take the trip
We started slow, then wild
Step by step, soft, soft
We are going to stick a little bit
When you kiss me with that skill
I see that you are malice with delicacy
Step by step, soft, soft
We are sticking together, little by little (oh oh)
And that beauty is a puzzle (oh no)
But to assemble it here I have the piece (slow, oh yeah)
Slowly (yeh, me)
I want to breathe your neck slowly (me)
Let me tell you things in your ear (me)
So that you remember if you are not with me
Slowly
I want to undress you with kisses slowly (yeh)
Sign the walls of your maze
And make your whole body a manuscript (go up, go up, go up)
(Go up, go up) Oh
I want to see your hair dance
I want to be your rhythm (uh oh, uh oh)
That you teach my mouth (uh oh, uh oh)
Your favorite places (favorite, favorite baby)
Let me bypass your danger zones (uh oh, uh oh)
Until you provoke your screams (uh oh, uh oh)
And forget your last name
Slowly
Let's do it on a beach in Puerto Rico
Until the waves cry "Oh blessed"
So that my stamp stays with you (dance it)
Little step by little, soft soft (hey yeah, yeah)
We are sticking together, little by little (oh no)
That you teach my mouth (uh oh, uh oh)
Your favorite places (favorite, favorite baby)
Step by step, soft, soft
We are going to stick a little bit
Until you provoke your screams (eh-oh) (Fonsi)
And forget your last name (DY)
Slowly
