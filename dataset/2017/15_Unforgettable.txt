If it were always sunshine
Tell me, would you miss the rain?
I kinda like the rain sometimes
Every now and again (now and again)
Ooh, tell me how you'd feel
If it were always the same
'Cause in reality, love and happiness live next to pain
Goin' through changes
Ayy, I saw you the other day, yeah
You turned around, looked the other way, yeah
I feel like we got somethin' we should say
We should say now
Feel like we been runnin' from the brand new
You know, you know
You know we can make it through the rain
You know, you know
You know we can make it through the rain
You know, you know
You know we can make it through the rain
You know, you know
You know we can make it
You can make it through bad weather
I can make it through whatever
She choosin' me, she so selective
Diamonds hit but nothin' sexual
Where will you be when the sun dies
When there's rainfall on your blue skies
Got your own scene, feel your heart changin'
Got your own scene, live a fantasy
You can use me 'til you lose, lose me
You can use me 'til you lose, lose me
You can use me 'til you lose, lose me
You can use me 'til you lose, lose me
Ayy, I saw you the other day, yeah
You turned around, looked the other way, yeah
I feel like we got somethin' we should say
We should say now
I feel like we been runnin' from the brand new
You know, you know
You know we can make it through the rain
You know, you know
You know we can make it through the rain
You know, you know
You know we can make it through the rain
You know, you know
You know we can make it
It's pourin' down on me, I won't complain
'Cause I kinda like the rain sometimes
Every now and again (now and again)
Say you loved me one time (say you loved me one time)
But did that season change? (oh)
I been on the frontline (yeah)
Since this love war began, yeah
And we could try to clean it up
But the stain still remains
'Cause in reality, love and happiness live next to pain
Goin' through changes
Ayy, I saw you the other day, yeah
You turned around, looked the other way, yeah
I feel like we got somethin' we should say
We should say now
I feel like we been runnin' from the brand new
You know, you know
You know we can make it through the rain
You know, you know
You know we can make it through the rain
You know, you know
You know we can make it through the rain
You know, you know
You know we can make it
