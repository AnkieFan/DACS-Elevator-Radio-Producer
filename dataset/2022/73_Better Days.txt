Better days are comin'
If no one told you
I hate to hear you cryin'
Over the phone, dear
For seven years runnin'
You've been a soldier
But better days are comin'
Better days are comin' for you
So when the night feels like forever
(Mh-mh)
I'll remember what you said to me
I know you've been hurtin'
Waitin' on a train that just won't come
The rain, it ain't permanent
And soon, we'll be dancin' in the sun
We'll be dancin' in the sun
And we'll sing your song together (eh-eh, eh-eh)
And we'll sing your song together (eh-eh, eh-eh)
We never miss the flowers
Until the sun's down
We never count the hours
Until they're runnin' out
You're on the other side of the storm now
You should be so proud
And better days are comin'
Better days are comin' for you
So when the night feels like forever
(Mh-mh)
I'll remember what you said to me
I know you've been hurting (is our time ever soothing?)
Waiting on a train that just won't come
The rain, it ain't permanent (is our time ever soothing?)
And soon, we'll be dancing in the sun
We'll be dancing in the sun
And we'll sing your song together (eh-eh, eh-eh)
And we'll sing your song together (eh-eh, eh-eh)
And we'll sing your song together (eh-eh, eh-eh)
And we'll sing your song together (eh-eh, eh-eh)
Your story's gonna change
Just wait for better days
You've seen too much of pain
Now, you don't even know
That your story's gonna change
Just wait for better days
I promise you, I won't let go
I know you've been hurting
Waiting on a train that just won't come
The rain, it ain't permanent (is our time ever soothing?)
And soon, we'll be dancing in the sun
We'll be dancing in the sun
And we'll sing your song together (eh-eh, eh-eh)
And we'll sing your song together (eh-eh, eh-eh)
And we'll sing your song together (eh-eh, eh-eh)
And we'll sing your song together (eh-eh, eh-eh)
