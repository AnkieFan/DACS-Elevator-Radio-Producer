You said you hated the ocean, but you're surfing now
I said I'd love you forever, but I just sold our house
We were kids at the start, guess we're grown up now (Mmm)
I would never even imagine having doubts
But not everything works, no

Now I'm out there dancing with strangers
You could be dating casually
Damn, everything is changing so fast

That's life, yeah
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yes, love came and knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
That's life, yeah, yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely on my feet but now I'm dancing
He's all over me (Enjoy)

Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam (That's life)
Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (Uh-huh)
Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (Eh, eh, uh-huh)
Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (Uh-huh)
Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam

It's been a hell of a year, thank God we made it
Yeah, we were riding a wave and trying not to drown
And on the surface, I held it together
But underneath, I kind of came around
Where would I be? You are all I need
My world baby you hold me
You always hold me but

I've been breaker and broken
Every mistake becomes moments
Wouldn't take anything back

That's life, yeah (That's how it is)
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yes, love came and knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
That's life, yeah, yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely on my feet but now I'm dancing
She's all over me (He's all over me)

Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam (There, there)
Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-ra, bam-bam-bam-bam (Add sugar, people)
And keep dancing (Heh), and keep dancing
Keep dancing, yeah (Uh-huh)
And keep dancing, keep dancing, yeah
And keep dancing (Eh!) (There's love everywhere)

Keep dancing yeah (Ah!), keep dancing (Hey!)

Keep dancing, woah (Keep going, keep going, keep dancing)

Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yes, love came and knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
That's life, yeah
Yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely on my feet but now I'm dancing
