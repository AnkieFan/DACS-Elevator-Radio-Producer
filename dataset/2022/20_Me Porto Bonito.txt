Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, hey
The smell of your perfume stayed in the bus
You are a villain, I am a villain, that is what does not unite
She knows that she is hot and they don't show her off
If I were your cat, I would upload a photo on Fridays and Mondays (So)

So that the whole world sees how rich you are, that you are
with you I have to squeeze
And in the street I'm loose, but for you I take off
If you ask me, I behave pretty
And I upload a selfie so they can see how rich you are, that you are
The others have to squeeze
In the street I'm loose, but for you I take off
If you ask me to, I behave pretty (Hey, hey)

You are not a baby, you are a baby
Frikitona, ma', it shows
He likes threesomes 'when she is in the note
If the boyfriend is useless, throw him away
And wow, mommy, tell me where I put the resume (RÃ©sume)
I know you left a month ago (Hey, hey)
And from one of my chest I buzzed
If you want, I'll make you a baby or bring you plan B
Uff, mommy, how delicious you look'
For the 2000s I listened to RBD
And now she wants to perreo, all night on the wall
THC, not CBD

Mommy, you are elite (Hey), don't limit me (Okay)
Let me do what you deserve and levitate you
Give it to the hideout (Hey), don't jeopardize me' (So)
That the 'satellite' will not be able to reach here (Oh)
Mommy, upload something, give me content
Turn that ass up more often
I spend hanging out, to see if I agree, hey
And finally I give you
Mai, our 'bellaquera' I never forget her
None like you has pleased me
You believe that I always tell them the same to all
He wants to fuck, but he doesn't want anything fixed, hey
But in confidence he confesses to me
She says that no one cares
But when she goes out, she gets naughty (Hey)

So that the whole world sees how rich you are, that you are, hey
with you I have to squeeze
And in the street I'm loose, but for you I take off
If you ask me, I behave pretty
