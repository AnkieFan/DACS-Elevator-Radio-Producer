Yeah, this could be your last drink from a stranger in a bar
The last time that you're dancin' in unfamiliar arms
Yeah, this could be your last first kiss if we do this thing right
Your last time alone beneath neon lights
It could be your last night comin' in here, drinkin' all by yourself
The last time givin' your heart away to someone else
Yeah, we could be some history in the makin', girl
Tonight might be your last night lonely
Yeah, you could be the last first name that's ever been worth askin'
Yeah, you could be the last phone number I write down on a napkin
Yeah, you could be the last girl that I take back home to mama
The last time that we're talked about in this small town drama
It's gonna be the last night comin' in here, drinkin' all by yourself
The last time givin' your heart away to someone else
Yeah, we could be some history in the makin', girl
Tonight might be your last night lonely
It could be your last night lonely
It could be your last night comin' in here, drinkin' all by yourself
The last time givin' your heart away to someone else
Yeah, we could be some history in the makin', girl
Tonight might be your last night lonely
It could be your last night comin' in here, drinkin' all by yourself
The last time givin' your heart away to someone else
Yeah, we could be some history in the makin', girl
Tonight might be your last night lonely
It could be your last night lonely, yeah
Last night lonely, baby
