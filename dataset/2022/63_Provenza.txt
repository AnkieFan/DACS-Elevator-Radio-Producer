Baby, what else?
I haven't heard from you for a while
'I was with someone, but I'm already free
Set to relive old times, I haven't been out for a long time
You tell me where it is, ah-ah-ah
It's been a while since I know anything about you (Nah about you)
'I was with someone, but I'm already free
Set to relive old times, I haven't been out for a long time (Shh)

Daddy, we get lost, we park and turn it on
For the dry we drink something, and when we get drunk
One of reggaeton we put 'and we go' to where we can love each other
We can eat each other (Eh-ah)
Daddy, we get lost, we park and turn it on
For the dry we drink something, and when we get drunk
One of reggaeton we put 'and we go' to where we can' want
We can eat

Baby, what else?
It's been a while (Wuh) that I don't know anything about you (Yeh)
'I was with someone, but I'm already free ('Toy free)
Set to relive old times, I haven't been out for a long time
You tell me where it is, ah-ah-ah (You tell me, you tell me)
It's been a while since I know anything about you (Nah about you)
'I was with someone, but I'm already free (Wuh)
Set to relive old times, I haven't been out for a long time

What bad can happen?
What's wrong with us? I'm outside, come out
We have things pending' to review
You are a difficult dust to replace (Yes)
I don't know if it convinces you (Hey)
We give ourselves a little touch through Provence
And if things get tense, in my bed the reward
Or vice versa, why do you think so? (No!)
We went through the neighborhood for grass (Grass)
Put it in the hookah so that it dissolves
The chemistry is still preserved
And I'll make it rich for you to come back'
Although I'm leaving tomorrow, take advantage of me because here I am
Set for you, that's why I wrote to you

Baby, what else?
I haven't heard from you for a while
'I was with someone, but I'm already free (Huh)
Set to relive old times, I haven't been out for a long time
You tell me where it is, ah-ah-ah (You tell me, you tell me)
It's been a while since I know anything about you (Nah about you)
'I was with someone, but I'm already free (Wuh)
Set to relive old times, I haven't been out for a long time
