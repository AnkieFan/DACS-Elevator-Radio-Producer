Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
eh-eh-eh-eh

I don't know if it's a coincidence that I feel like this
Whenever you are close to me
Tell me what did you do to me, what drug did you give me
That since that night I'm not the same
You look at me' and I start to sweat
I feel I can fly

Baby, the note is already taking effect
My world is screwed up and I feel perfect
Because you are here, moving like this, don't stop
Baby, you are my drug, tonight I did not lower it'
Because the note is already taking effect
My world is screwed up and I feel perfect
Because you are here, moving like this, don't stop
Baby, you are my drug, tonight I did not lower it'

This one no, this one yes
This one no, this one yes
This one no, this one yes
This one no, this one yes

To give him I have a license
Since we went to Florence
She got more bicha, but she doesn't lose her essence
No, no, from Carola
No, no, no, she's not alone
No, no, don't say "hello"
Or is it going to be another for the queue
Your picket is cool
I am a fan of that popola (Mua, mua)
Plus the picky, the endo, the coke and the song (More nothing)
It's you who controls me, huh (Hehe)

In your eyes I see the sea, mommy, take me on your wave (You are bad)
Today I feel good bitch, re cool, hey

Because the note is already taking effect
My world is screwed up and I feel perfect
Because you are here, moving like this, don't stop
Baby, you are my drug, tonight don't lower it'7Embed
