Jack makes good whiskey, yeah
Red dirt makes good ridin' roads
Country makes good music
For kickin' up dust in a tail light glow
Dry wood makes good fires
Goodyears make good swings
All that's all good but for me
God makes five foot nine, brown eyes, and a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey but God makes the good stuff
Oh, God makes the good stuff
Like that sweet little kiss she lays on me
When I pull up in the gravel drive
The way she dances with the raindrops
Like she's the reason why they fall from the sky
And I thank Him every time I close my eyes
God makes five foot nine, brown eyes, and a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey but God makes the good stuff
God made her so I will make sure
He didn't waste an angel on me
When he made five foot nine, brown eyes, and a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey but God makes the good stuff
Five foot nine, brown eyes, and a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey but God makes the good stuff (oh)
Yeah, God makes the good stuff
Yeah, God makes the good stuff (oh)
Whoa
