A long time ago I listen to the heart
And the days go by, the months thinking about your smell (In your smell, in your smell)
The time has come to use reason
Before it's too late and I accidentally break into do' (Break into do')

Before the sun rises, sink the accelerator
Even if I go without brakes and lose control
Nothing more' will be do', you and me caressing'
In the middle of time, without saying goodbye'

And just look at me (Look at me) with those pretty eyes (Pretty)
That with that I'm fine (-I'm fine), today I've been born again (Born)

It's been a long time (Time) that I haven't held anyone's hand (Hand)
It's been a while (Long time) that I haven't sent "Good morning, I love you" (I love you)
But, you have me 'entangled' or (Enreda'o), I wrapped myself (I wrapped)
I was going my way and I got lost (Hey, hey)
My gaze changed when I saw your eyes (I saw your eyes)
Bye-bye to the ass', I didn't even say goodbye
I didn't look for you (-what), no (No), we crashed on the way
With your soul is the one that I connect (-necto)
Don't worry, it doesn't have to be perfect, no
Here there is no sin (-cado) and to be wrong is beautiful
The errors' are pleasure' (-cere'), just like all' your little kisses'

And just look at me (Look at me) with those 'cute' eyes (Pretty')
That with that I'm fine (-I'm fine), today I was born again (Born)
And just look at me (Look at me) with those 'cute' eyes (Pretty')
That with that I'm fine (-I'm fine), today I was born again (Born)

You and me, you and me, you and me
You and me, you and me
You and me, you and me, you and me
You and me, you and me
You and me, you and me
You and me, you and me

I don't let myself be carried away by anyone
I just let myself be carried away by your smile (-laughter)
And from the mole close to your mouth (Mouth)
If I'm crazy, you're crazy (-quita)
But, baby, there is no other like you, no (No)
I want to give you girasole' (-sole')
Go to the beach and look for you snail'
When I'm with you, I don't look at the Role' (Role')
Let's go dance two hundred songs (-cione)
Nobody puts me like you puts me' (Pone')
Mm-mmm, mm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mm-mmm, mm-mmm-mmm-mmm
I speak to Dio' and you are' his answer
I learned that 'beautiful' moments never cost
like when you give me your look
And the sun its setting, and the sun its setting
Hey, hey, when I'm on top of you, of you
Mommy, I forget everything, everything
no one is needed here
only you and me
Before the sun rises, sink the accelerator
Even if I go without brakes and lose control
Nothing more' will be do', you and me caressing'
In the middle of time, without saying goodbye'

And just look at me (Look at me) with those 'cute' eyes (Pretty')
That with that I'm fine (-I'm fine), today I was born again (Born)
And just look at me (Look at me) with those 'cute' eyes (Pretty')
That with that I'm fine (-I'm fine), today I was born again (Birth)8Embed
