If I don't write to you
You don't write to me, hey
If you want, I look for you
I know where you live'
Maybe today she is hated
But inside you have' joy
If you want I'll take it out
Two drink' and you know
that I wear beautiful
we are not na'
But we've been 'involved' for a while
WhatsApp without the portrait
It doesn't save my contact (hey, hey, hey, hey)
But I take it out
Two drink' and you know
that I wear beautiful
we are not na'
But we've been involved for a while, oh-oh
WhatsApp without the portrait
It does not save my contact-to
Everything is underwater
Baby, let's go to the fourth quarter
In the Uru' eating' the pâté
I'm going to give you hard so that you don't compare me'
Hey, take care with that denim
What is going to break (hey)
That booty is going to break it (hey)
I don't know if I'll see you again
If tomorrow I'm going to lose
You are a player
you made me a crossover
This time you put
You gave me game over, huh, huh
because i can't forget
The dog that one
that went viral
Tell me if tomorrow you're going to stay
After the alarm I'll give it to you
Hey, today you are not going to work, heh, no
If you want I'll take it out
Two drink' and you know
that I wear beautiful
we are not na'
But we've been 'involved' for a while
WhatsApp without the portrait
does not save my contact
But I take it out
Two drink' and you know
that I wear beautiful
we are not na'
But we've been 'involved' for a while
WhatsApp without the portrait
does not save my contact
I like them that way
piquetúa
Mommy, how delicious you look' 'esnu'a
Maybe you didn't feel what I felt
But I still owe you a night in the suite
To give you a table
Come on, mommy, talk
You are a devil
Don't make you
To give you a table
Come on, mommy, talk
You are a devil
Don't make you
No, no, no, no (no, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no (no, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no (no, no, no, no)
Hey, I don't know about you
But I would like to dawn 'esnu'
On a beach in Bali, if not, Cancun
Ask for another Moscow Mule (hey)
that I'm on note, note
come and crash
fuck with me
Baby, you're big
But today I'm on note, note
come and crash
Fuck with me, huh
fuck it, hey
Mommy, you want perreo
you want perreo
you want bellaqueo
you want bellaqueo
Mommy, you want perreo
you want perreo
you want bellaqueo
