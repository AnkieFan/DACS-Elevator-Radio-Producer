There came the storm that night
It blew out the city lights
A bit too dark inside
We lit some candlelights up
Nobody’s home
We melt into the candlelights
Poured you some of the wine
And then you filled up mine too
You kept me warm that night
Under those candlelights
Was dripping hard outside
At last a safer place to hide
Woo-ohh-ohh
Woo-ohh-ohh

Whatever happened that night
We just won’t recite
Now those moments we’d had
All snuffed out like those candlelights

(All snuffed like candlelights)
Left up to broken memories
(All snuffed like candlelights)
Only a glimmer in me now
(Snuffed out like candlelights)
Those moments we just won’t recite
You might also like
There came the storm that night
It blew out the city lights
A bit too dark inside
We lit some candlelights up
You kept me warm that night
Under those candlelights
Was dripping hard outside
At last a safer place to hide

Whatever happened that night
We just won’t recite
Now those moments we’d had
All snuffed out like those candlelights

Woo-ohh-ohh
Woo-ohh-ohhEmbed
