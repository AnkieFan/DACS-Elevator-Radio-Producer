Like a star shining, in your eyes
Sometimes I wonder why
I just wanna hold your hand and walk with you side by side
I know you know
I love you baby
I know you know
I love you baby
Just wanted you to know
I love you, I love you, I love you....
I just want to love you baby
I know you know
I love you baby
I know you know
I love you baby
Just want you to know
You're my sunshine in the sky
I will be waiting for you, babeYou might also like2Embed
