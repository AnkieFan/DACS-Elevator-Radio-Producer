Jellyfish happy swimming
Come swim over my heart
Lingering deep down the sea
Please, don’t pull me up
Jellyfish happy dreaming
Even the water is hot
Lingering, it's so carefree
Please, don’t wake me up

Answer me
Show me the way
Tell me where I can find you
On the moon?
Deep under the sea?
Is true love meant to be found?

Now I don’t mind
Just being alone
I have a good time
To be on my own
But I somеtimes
Think about you
Bubbles sink down into the sеa
You might also like
Jellyfish happy dreaming
Even the water is hot
Lingering, it's so carefree
Please, don’t wake me up

Lingering in the ocean of love
We swim together then breaking apart
And my crystal heart
Is never the same
The ocean of love
It is time to say goodbye

Now I don’t mind
Just being alone
I have a good time
To be on my own
But I sometimes
Think about you
Bubbles sink down into the sea

Jellyfish happy swimming
Lingering, deep down the sea
Jellyfish happy swimming
Lingering, it's so carefreeEmbed
