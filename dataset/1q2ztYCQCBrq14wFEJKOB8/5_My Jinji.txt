Every time you lie in my place
I do wanna say
It to you, you my babe
I won't be too late

My Jinji, don't you cry
In this world out of time
Old time out of mind
My Jinji, please don't cry
In this world out of time
Time out of mind
Out of mind

Every time you lie in my place
I do wanna say
It to you, you my babe
I'm down to the drain

Oh Jinji, don't you cry
In this world out of time
Old time out of mind
My Jinji, please don't lie
In this world out of time
Time out of mind
Out of mind
You might also like
Every time you lie in my place
I do wanna say
It to you, you my babe
It won't be too late

Oh, don't leave me behind
Without you, I would cry
'Cause only you, my babe
Only you can conquer time
Only you can conquer time
Oh, sometimes I
Without you, I would cry
'Cause only you, my babe
Only you can conquer time

Oh, don't leave me behind
Without you, I would cry
'Cause only you, my babe
Only you can conquer time
Only you can conquer time
Oh, sometimes I
Without you, I would cry
'Cause only you, my babe
Only you can conquer time
Only you can conquer time
