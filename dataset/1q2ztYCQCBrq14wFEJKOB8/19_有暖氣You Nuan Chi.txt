Stuck in a traffic beside the sea
Maybe it will be late but you donâ€™t mind
Selfish like you
Selfish like you
Now 21
You need to shake your body
We both understand
People's getting groovy
Now 21
You like to shake your body
We both satisfy
Come on come on stay in light
Selfish like you
Selfish like you
Selfish like you
Selfish like you
Now 21
You need to shake your body
We both understand
People's getting groovy
Now 21
You like to shake your body
We both satisfy
Come on come on stay in light

Like to shake off gravity
Both understand
Shape is getting wavy
You chosen one
Deserve a better story
We both stellify
Baby baby save my lifeEmbed
