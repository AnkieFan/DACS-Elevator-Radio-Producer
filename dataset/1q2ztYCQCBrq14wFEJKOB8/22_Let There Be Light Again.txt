Let there be light again
Time to see the light again
All I need is love, please
Take me back from darkness
Day and night and night and day
Starlights are fading far away
I’m waiting for your love, please
Shine on me through darkness

I
Oh wonder why
You closed the door that night
I thought you could be the light of my life
I
Oh wonder why
You make me a fool that night
I beg you to be the light of my life

May the sky be bright again
May the eyes be bright again
All I seek is love, please
Take me back from darkness
You might also likeLone star in the Milky Way
Does it feel like cast away
I’ve been waiting for your love, please
Shine on me through darkness

I
Oh wonder why
You closed the door that night
I thought you could be the light of my life
I
Oh wonder why
You make me a fool that night
I beg you to be the light of my life

Where’s my light?
Could you let it shine on me?
Run through the night
Would you hold me tight?
See through your eyes
Don’t you ever cry for me
Run through the night
I will hold you tight
Where’s my light?...1Embed
