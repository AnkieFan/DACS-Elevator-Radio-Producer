I won’t get you this time
You just give a call to your uncle change
Before it’s too late
Don’t you pick up a fight
Why don’t you recognize my sign
Nice slow jam, do it all the way
I’m sober this time
You better break down your knees and pray
Before it’s too late
Don’t you pick up a fight why don’t you recognize my sign
It’s gonna happen
And sins go deeper
I show you my red sign anyway
Don’t you try to make me mad
You know I’m bad
I show you my red sign anywayYou might also likeEmbed
