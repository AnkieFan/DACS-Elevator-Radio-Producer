We take it easy, but it's not typical
He already knows that my love is fire
His heart was a stone, but then his hands wandered
I turned him into gold and that made him happy

Well I'll be your fantasy, I'll be your favorite things
we could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to paradise
Say you'll never let me go

Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew
A hideout
We could spend the night watching an old movie
Smoke some weed on my couch in the back room
A hideout
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go

Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
oh
oh
Say you'll never let me go

Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew
A hideout
We could spend the night watching an old movie
Smoke some weed on my couch in the back room
A hideout
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go

Say you'll never let me go
